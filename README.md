# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my first project on Python!

## About

This is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three 1's or three 2's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares. The player can decide if they would like to play a larger scale version of tic tac toe initially prior to the start of the game. This game can be replayed after the game is completed by prompted.

## Summary

I hope to improve this project later on once I learn more about AI. This will mean that a CPU can be selected to play against.
